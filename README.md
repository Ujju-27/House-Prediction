# HOUSE PREDICTION SYSTEM 
IT IS AN ML BASED Predictor System which is used to predict the Housing Prices of Mumbai City in which I take the inputs location, bhk, area, GYM from users.
Based on the Data, My MODEL Predicts the Estimated Price of this City is in Lakhs/Crores.

ALGORITHMS WHICH I USED IN THIS MODEL:-
1. LINEAR REGRESSION
2. LASSO
3. RIDGE MODEL FOR PICKLEING THE FILE
IN THE ABOVE THREE MODELS RIDGE MODEL IS VERY EFFICIENT IN COMPARISON OF ACCURACY I.E. (89%)

I MAKE THE FLASK APP FOR BETTER UI FOR BEST EXPERIENCED FOR THE USERS WHICH I USED THE SIMPLER HTML JUST FOR DISPLAYING PURPOSE.
